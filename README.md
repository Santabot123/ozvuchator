- Auto mode - you select an area of the screen and when a new text appears in this area, it will be automatically spoken.



# Note

- If you have an Nvidia video card installed, it will be used by default, in all other cases the CPU will be used
- The longer the text is, the longer the delay before the voice is generated
- If you are going to use this program during the game, you may need to switch the game to windowed/borderless mode
